You float higher and higher, and soon the world seems small beneath you. However, you are safe. The spirits carry you. And you know you’ll find your way home. In that exact moment, you feel something inside you shifting. It feels like it’s always been there, just hidden. Suddenly the way home lies in front of you clearly. You know who you are and where to go."
